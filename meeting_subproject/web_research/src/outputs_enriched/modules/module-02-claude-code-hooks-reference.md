### Key Excerpts

> You can use the environment variable `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` (only available when
Claude Code spawns the hook command) to reference scripts stored in your project,
ensuring they work regardless of Claude's current directory:
> — Source: `Claude Code Hooks Reference.md`

> Claude Code hooks work seamlessly with
[Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools](/en/docs/claude-code/mcp). When MCP servers
provide tools, they appear with a special naming pattern that you can match in
your hooks.

> * **Timeout**: 60-second execution limit by default, configurable per command.
  * A timeout for an individual command does not affect the other commands.
* **Parallelization**: All matching hooks run in parallel
* **Deduplication**: Multiple identical hook commands are deduplicated automatically
* **Environment**: Runs in current directory with Claude Code's environment
  * The `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` environment variable is available and contains the
    absolute path to the project root directory (where Claude Code was started)
* **Input**: JSON via stdin
* **Output**:
  * PreToolUse/PostToolUse/Stop/SubagentStop: Progress shown in transcript (Ctrl-R)
  * Notification/SessionEnd: Logged to debug only (`--debug`)
  * UserPromptSubmit/SessionStart: stdout added as context for Claude

> 1. **Inspect hook execution** - Use `claude --debug` to see detailed hook
   execution
2. **Validate JSON schemas** - Test hook input/output with external tools
3. **Check environment variables** - Verify Claude Code's environment is correct
4. **Test edge cases** - Try hooks with unusual file paths or inputs
5. **Monitor system resources** - Check for resource exhaustion during hook
   execution
6. **Use structured logging** - Implement logging in your hook scripts
