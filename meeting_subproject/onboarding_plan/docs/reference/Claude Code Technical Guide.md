# Claude Code Complete Technical Guide

Claude Code represents a paradigm shift in AI-assisted development, functioning as **an agentic development partner rather than a traditional code assistant**. Unlike conventional tools that rely on static indexing, Claude Code employs dynamic, real-time codebase exploration through specialized tools, delivering superior accuracy and context-aware coding assistance.

## Project indexing fundamentally reimagined

**Claude Code doesn't perform traditional indexing**. Instead, it uses "agentic search" - a dynamic exploration system that outperformed traditional RAG indexing "by a lot" in Anthropic's testing. When you say "index my Python project," you're actually initiating an intelligent codebase exploration process.

### What happens technically during "indexing"

The system employs four core built-in tools that work automatically:
- **Glob**: Fast file pattern matching (`"*.py"`, `"src/**/*.ts"`)
- **Grep**: Content search using regex patterns  
- **Read**: On-demand file content reading
- **LS**: Directory listing and structure analysis

This approach delivers **~40% token reduction** compared to loading entire directories while maintaining superior accuracy through real-time code analysis. Files are never pre-processed into static indexes - instead, Claude dynamically discovers and analyzes code relationships as needed.

### Essential commands for project understanding

```bash
# Core workflow commands
claude                              # Start in project directory
/init                              # Generate initial CLAUDE.md context
/config                           # Access project settings
/memory                          # Edit memory files

# Project exploration patterns
"What is the structure of this project?"
"Find all Python files related to authentication"
"Read the main configuration files"
"Explain how the database layer works"
```

The system automatically respects `.gitignore` patterns and excludes common build directories (`node_modules`, `__pycache__`), ensuring focused analysis on relevant code.

## Complete command reference and documentation access

Claude Code provides an extensive command system with both built-in and customizable commands:

### Built-in slash commands

| Command | Functionality |
|---------|---------------|
| `/bug` | Report bugs directly to Anthropic |
| `/clear` | Reset conversation history |
| `/compact [instructions]` | Compress conversation with optional focus |
| `/config` | View/modify configuration settings |
| `/cost` | Display token usage statistics |
| `/doctor` | Check installation health |
| `/help` | Access usage documentation |
| `/init` | Initialize CLAUDE.md project guide |
| `/login` / `/logout` | Manage Anthropic account authentication |
| `/memory` | Edit CLAUDE.md memory files |
| `/model` | Select AI model (Sonnet/Opus) |
| `/permissions` | Configure tool access permissions |
| `/review` | Initiate code review workflows |
| `/status` | Check system status |
| `/vim` | Enable vim keybindings |

### Custom command system

Create project-specific commands in `.claude/commands/` for team sharing:

```markdown
# .claude/commands/security-audit.md
Perform comprehensive security analysis on $ARGUMENTS:
1. Search for SQL injection vulnerabilities
2. Check authentication/authorization patterns
3. Analyze input validation
4. Review dependency security
5. Generate security report with remediation steps
```

Usage: `/project:security-audit src/auth.py`

### Accessing documentation locally

While Claude Code doesn't provide official download documentation, you can create comprehensive local documentation:

```bash
# Setup local documentation structure
mkdir -p ~/.claude/local-docs/{commands,config,examples}

# Create comprehensive command reference
# ~/.claude/local-docs/commands/reference.md
```

Import in your user CLAUDE.md:
```markdown
# ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
@~/.claude/local-docs/commands/reference.md
@~/.claude/local-docs/config/settings-guide.md
```

## CLAUDE.md configuration mastery

CLAUDE.md serves as Claude Code's **project memory system**, following a hierarchical loading pattern:

### Memory hierarchy (in order of precedence)
1. **Enterprise Policy**: System-wide managed settings
2. **Project Memory**: `./CLAUDE.md` (team-shared, version controlled)
3. **User Memory**: `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (personal, all projects)
4. **Local Project**: `./CLAUDE.local.md` (git-ignored overrides)

### Optimal CLAUDE.md structure

```markdown

```

### Advanced CLAUDE.md features

**File imports for modular configuration:**
```markdown
# Import project documentation
@README.md
@docs/architecture.md
@package.json

# Include personal workflow preferences
@~/.claude/my-coding-standards.md
```

**Dynamic memory addition:**
Use `#` prefix during development to quickly add context:
```bash
# This gets added to memory files automatically
```

## Vibe coding mastery and workflow optimization

**"Vibe coding"** represents a strategic development approach where developers express high-level intent and let Claude handle implementation details through natural language interaction.

### Core vibe coding principles

**Express intent, not implementation:**
Instead of: "Create a React component with useState for form handling"
Use: "I want users to edit their profile with a delightful, intuitive interface"

Claude adds thoughtful touches you didn't explicitly request - user avatars, validation feedback, loading states, and accessibility features.

**Strategic planning with thinking triggers:**
- `"think"` → Basic extended reasoning
- `"think hard"` → Deeper analysis with more computation
- `"think harder"` → Comprehensive reasoning with multiple approaches  
- `"ultrathink"` → Maximum thinking budget for complex problems

### Optimal project structure for vibe coding

```

```

### The "Explore, Plan, Code, Commit" pattern

**Phase 1 - Strategic Exploration:**
```bash
"Read the authentication system but don't write code yet"
"Understand the database schema before making changes"
"Analyze the existing component patterns"
```

**Phase 2 - Deep Planning:**
```bash
"Think harder about implementing OAuth integration"
"Create a detailed plan for the shopping cart feature"
"Outline the testing strategy for this microservice"
```

**Phase 3 - Implementation with Verification:**
```bash
"Implement the plan with explicit test verification"
"Build this feature following our established patterns"
"Create the component with full TypeScript support"
```

**Phase 4 - Documentation and Integration:**
```bash
"Generate descriptive commit message for these changes"
"Update the README with new feature documentation"  
"Create a pull request with comprehensive description"
```

## Technical implementation and context management

Claude Code's context management represents sophisticated engineering optimized for real-world development workflows.

### Context architecture fundamentals

**Token Management:**
- **Standard Context**: 200,000 tokens (~150,000 words)
- **Extended Context**: 1,000,000 tokens for Sonnet 4 (beta)
- **Cost Calculation**: ~750 words = 1,000 tokens
- **Auto-Compact**: Triggers at 95% capacity to preserve essential information

**Context Components:**
```
Total Context = Input Tokens + Current Turn + Thinking Tokens + Tool Use Tokens
```

### Performance optimization strategies

**Context Window Management:**
```bash
/clear                    # Reset context between unrelated tasks
/compact "focus on auth"  # Compress conversation with specific focus
/cost                     # Monitor token usage in real-time
```

**Subagent Delegation:**
Use subagents for complex analysis to preserve main context:
```bash
"Create a subagent to analyze the test suite architecture"
"Have a specialized agent review security vulnerabilities"  
```

**Progressive Thinking Allocation:**
Control computational resources with thinking triggers - use `"ultrathink"` sparingly for maximum efficiency.

### Advanced technical features

**Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration:**
```json
// .mcp.json configuration
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "github": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
      "env": {"GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "your_token"}
    },
    "puppeteer": {
      "command": "npx", 
      "args": ["@modelcontextprotocol/server-puppeteer"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Codebase Structure Optimization:**
- **Single Responsibility**: Each file serves one clear purpose
- **Shallow Hierarchies**: Avoid deep nesting that complicates context
- **Explicit Dependencies**: Clear import/export patterns
- **Co-located Documentation**: Keep relevant docs near implementation

**Performance Monitoring:**
```bash
/status                   # System health and rate limits
/doctor                   # Installation diagnostics
ccusage                   # Third-party usage analysis tool
```
