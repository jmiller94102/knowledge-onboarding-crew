### Recipe: Quick Task Using a Reference
1. Review the reference item above.
2. Run or adapt this example:

```bash
```markdown
# Import project documentation
@README.md
@docs/architecture.md
@package.json

# Include personal workflow preferences
@~/.claude/my-coding-standards.md
```

**Dynamic memory addition:**
Use `#` prefix during development to quickly add context:
```bash
# This gets added to memory files automatically
```
```
