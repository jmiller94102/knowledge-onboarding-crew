### Key Excerpts

> ### Introduction to Cloud Code
- **Extensive discussion points:**
  Patrick opened the discussion by addressing a common question he receives: "What’s the difference between Claude Code and Cursor?" He emphasized that Claude Code excels in **multi-step processing**, enabling users to break down complex tasks into subtasks and execute them sequentially. Patrick mentioned, “I use it for starting projects constantly... I just let Claude Code run freely,” highlighting the tool's utility in project initiation and management.
