> **Express intent, not implementation:**
Instead of: "Create a React component with useState for form handling"
Use: "I want users to edit their profile with a delightful, intuitive interface"

> **Phase 3 - Implementation with Verification:**
```bash
"Implement the plan with explicit test verification"
"Build this feature following our established patterns"
"Create the component with full TypeScript support"
