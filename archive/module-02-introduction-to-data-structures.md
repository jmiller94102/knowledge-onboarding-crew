### Key Excerpts

> Custom slash commands allow you to define frequently-used prompts as Markdown files that Claude Code can execute. Commands are organized by scope (project-specific or personal) and support namespacing through directory structures.
> — Source: `Claude Code Slash reference.md`

> ## Key Decisions
- Claude Code should be utilized for both coding and non-coding workflows.
- Standardization of prompt structures is crucial for maximizing productivity.
- Increase collaboration through shared tools and resources.

> ### Introduction to Cloud Code
- **Extensive discussion points:**
  Patrick opened the discussion by addressing a common question he receives: "What’s the difference between Claude Code and Cursor?" He emphasized that Claude Code excels in **multi-step processing**, enabling users to break down complex tasks into subtasks and execute them sequentially. Patrick mentioned, “I use it for starting projects constantly... I just let Claude Code run freely,” highlighting the tool's utility in project initiation and management.
